# Windows Autopilot Overview

Windows Autopilot is a modern device provisioning approach that enables
Organisations to deploy and configure new devices with minimal manual effort.

## Why Autopilot Matters

Traditional device provisioning often requires:
- Manual configuration
- On-site IT involvement
- Long setup times

Autopilot supports a zero-touch provisioning model that allows devices to be:
- Shipped directly to users
- Automatically configured upon first sign-in
- Enrolled into device management platforms

## Benefits

- Reduced device setup time
- Improved consistency in configuration
- Better scalability during workforce growth
- Support for remote and hybrid work models

From a digital workplace perspective, Autopilot improves operational efficiency
and supports secure, scalable digital transformation.
